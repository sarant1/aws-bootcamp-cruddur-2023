### Learning Git

I was trying to use git cli and struggling so I decided to look up some commands.  I was confused on the difference between git pull and fetch and git merge.

git pull <remote> = git fetch <remote> && git merge <remote>/<branch>

```bash
git pull origin master
```
or

```bash
git fetch origin
git merge origin/master
```
