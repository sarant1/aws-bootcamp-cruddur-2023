# Week 3 â€” Decentralized Authentication

### Summary:
I had to remake my cognito user pool so that I could add preferred_username required attribute.  Had to rewatch livestream so that I could set up the new cognito pool with preferred_username attribute.  Now I am making my 3rd cognito user pool because I also had use name and email checked on creation.  For some reason my JWT token is not being passed to my backend.  I had a spelling mistake, headers != hheaders.
